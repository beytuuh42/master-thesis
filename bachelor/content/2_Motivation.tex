\chapter{Motivation}
The motivation for this topic as my thesis comes from a previous experiment. I tried to apply an algorithm to the Arcade games, but the results were not satisfying, although it seemed to be good.

By visualizing the algorithm, I was able to see its interaction with the environment, and it was clear that it is barely doing anything, although it achieved high score values. Through researching this topic area, I found out that algorithms, that are similar to this one, are behaving the same. State-of-the-art studies are not visualizing their algorithms interaction with environments; thus, it is not possible to say what the algorithm is doing.

Therefore, I was interested in the suitability of state-of-the-art evaluations and whether they are extendable, to extract further information from experiments.
